# rd-sys-ref-data-api

System Reference Data API

## Purpose

Provides system reference data to client applications.  Implemented as a Java/SpringBoot application.

### Prerequisites

To run the project you will need to have the following installed:

* Java 8
* Docker (optional)

For information about the software versions used to build this API and a complete list of it's dependencies see build.gradle

### Running the application

To run the API quickly use the docker helper script as follows:

```
./bin/run-in-docker.sh install
```


Alternatively, you can start the application from the current source files using Gradle as follows:

```
./gradlew clean bootRun
```

If required, to run with a low memory consumption, the following can be used:

```
./gradlew --no-daemon assemble && java -Xmx384m -jar build/libs/rd-sys-ref-data-api.jar
```

### Using the application

To understand if the application is working, you can call it's health endpoint:

```
curl http://localhost:8090/health
```

If the API is running, you should see this response:

```
{"status":"UP"}
```

### Running integration tests:


You can run the *integration tests* as follows:

```
./gradlew integration
```

### Running functional tests:

If the API is running (either inside a Docker container or via `gradle bootRun`) you can run the *functional tests* as follows:

```
./gradlew functional
```

If you want to run a specific scenario use this command:

```
./gradlew functional --tests <TestClassName> --info -Dscenario=RIA-XXX
```

### Running smoke tests:

If the API is running (either inside a Docker container or via `gradle bootRun`) you can run the *smoke tests* as follows:

```
./gradlew smoke
```

### Running mutation tests tests:

If you have some time to spare, you can run the *mutation tests* as follows:

```
./gradlew pitest
```

As the project grows, these tests will take longer and longer to execute but are useful indicators of the quality of the test suite.
